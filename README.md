# REST API 

  * REST or RESTful stands for REpresentational State Transfer.
  * In simpler terms, it is an application program interface (API) that makes use of the HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE the data over WWW.
  * The main functions used in any REST-based architecture are:

           ## GET − Provides read-only access to a resource.
           ## PUT − Creates a new resource.
           ## DELETE − Removes a resource.
           ## POST − Updates an existing resource or creates a new resource.
